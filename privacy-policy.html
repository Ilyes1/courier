                More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><span class="fw-bold">Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</span> We may share your data with third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work.

            <h2>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">In Short:</span>  We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Policy.
            </p>
            <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">In Short:</span>  We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p>
            <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">In Short:</span>  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.
            </p>
            <h2>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">In Short:</span>  We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@hirereadynow.com
            </p>
            <h2>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">In Short:</span>  You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" class="text-blue">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Cookies and similar technologies:</span> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.
            </p>
            <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <h2>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">In Short:</span>  Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
            </p>
            <p>
